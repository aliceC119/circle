## Advanced Front-End Portfolio Project (PP5)

The goal of this project is to create an interactive online platform where classical music enthusiasts can connect and share their thoughts about their favorite classical artists and composers. Users will have the ability to post pictures of their favorite musicians and share YouTube videos of performances. Additionally, users can easily copy and share links to these posts and videos across other online platforms.
